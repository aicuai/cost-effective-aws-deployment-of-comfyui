## Getting Started

### Prepare the AWS environment

For the sake of reproducability and consistency, we recommend using [AWS Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/welcome.html) IDE for deploying and testing this solution.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can use your local development environment, but you will need to **make sure that you have AWS CLI, AWS CDK and Docker properly setup**. Additionally, if you're building your docker image using apple chips (M1, M2, etc.) then you need to use the Docker ```docker build --platform linux/amd64 .``` command.

<details>
<summary>Click to see environment setup with Cloud9</summary>

1. Login to AWS Console
2. Navigate to Cloud9
3. Create Environment with following example details:
    - Name: Give your Dev Environment a name of choice
    - Instance Type: t2.micro (default) got a free-tier
    - Platform: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
    - Timeout: 30 minutes
    - Other settings can be configured with the default values
4. Create and open environment
5. resize disk space
    ```bash
    curl -o resize.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/semantic-search-aws-docs/main/cloud9/resize.sh
    chmod +x ./resize.sh
    ./resize.sh 100
    ```
6. git clone <enter this repo URL here>
7. cd into new directory
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to see environment setup with Local environment</summary>

If you do not have AWS CLI, follow [AWS CLI Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

If you do not have CDK, follow [CDK Start Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

If you do not have Docker follow [Docker Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

If you haven't setup AWS CLI after installation, execute the following commands on your local environment:

```bash
aws configure
```

When prompted, enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and then the default region name (eg. us-east-1). You can leave the output format field as default or specify it as per your preference.
</details>

After setting up environment, set environment variable below. These variables will be used in many of the commands below.

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<aws_region> # e.g. "us-east-1", "eu-central-1"
export AWS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=<your_account_id> # e.g. 123456789012
export ECR_REPO_NAME="comfyui"
```

### Build & push docker image to ECR

You could build & reference your docker image in CDK directly, but we're using docker build and push the image to ECR, that we don't need to build the docker image with every CDK deployment. Additionally, the image is getting scanned
for vulnerabilites as soon as you push the image to ECR. You can achieve this as following:

1. Create an ECR repository and login
```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $ECR_REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
```
2. Login to ECR
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$ECR_REPO_NAME
```
3. Build docker image (make sure you're in the same directory as your dockerfile)
```
docker build -t comfyui .
# or alternatively if you are using M1 / M2 / ... Mac
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t comfyui .
```
4. Tag and push docker image to ECR
```
docker tag comfyui:latest $AWS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$ECR_REPO_NAME:latest
docker push $AWS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$ECR_REPO_NAME:latest
```

### Deploying ComfyUI

1. (First time only) Install Required Dependency
```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. (First time only) If you use CDK in your first time in an account/region, then you need to run following command to bootstrap your account. For subsequent deployments this step is not required anymore
```bash
cdk bootstrap
```
3. Deploy ComfyUI to your default AWS account and region
```bash
cdk deploy
```

Depending on your custom_nodes and extenstions in the dockerfile, the deployment will take approx. 8-10 minutes to have ComfyUI ready
 
 ```
 ‚úÖ  ComfyUIStack

‚ú®  Deployment time: 579.07s

Outputs:
ComfyUIStack.CognitoDomainName = comfyui-alb-auth-XXXXXXX
ComfyUIStack.Endpoint = ComfyUiALB-XXXXX.uw-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
ComfyUIStack.UserPoolId = us-west-2_XXXXXXX
Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:[us-east-1]:[your-account-id]:stack/ComfyUIStack/[uuid]

‚ú®  Total time: 582.53s
```

You can access application from output value of `ComfyUIStack.Endpoint`.

### Uploading models

1. You can install models, loras, embedding, controlnets over ComfyUI-Manager or other extension (custom node). See [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#model-installation) for detail.
2. You can extend (optional) and execute the upload script in this repo with a preselected list of models, controlnets etc. If the SSM command is not working, make sure that the role you are using is allowed to access the EC2. You'll find some additional examples in the `/scripts/upload_models.sh` file.

```bash
# 1. SSM into EC2
aws ssm start-session --target "$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ComfyUIStack/Host" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId]' --output text)" --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

# 2. SSH into Container
container_id=$(sudo docker container ls --format '{{.ID}} {{.Image}}' | grep 'comfyui:latest$' | awk '{print $1}')
sudo docker exec -it $container_id /bin/bash

# 3. install models, loras, controlnets or whatever you need (you can also include all in a script and execute it to install)

# FACE SWAP EXAMPLE Upscaler - https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Real-ESRGAN
wget -c https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Real-ESRGAN/blob/main/RealESRGAN_x2.pth -P ./models/upscale_models/
```

### Access ComfyUI

The deployed solution provides an EC2 accessible through an Application Load Balancer. The Load Balancer requires authentication through Amazon Cognito User Pool. To create the admin user (and apply a post-deployment fix related to upper case letters in the Load Balancer URL) you will need to run a script before to proceed. The password is contained in the variable `user_password` and `should` be customized before to run the script.  

‚ùó Update the user_password variable before running the script  

```python
python scripts/cognito_post_deploy_fix.py
```

Or alternatively you may enable self-signup / SAML authentication / manually create user in Cognito console.

### Delete deployments and cleanup resources

For the sake of preventing data loss from accidental deletions and keeping the example as straightforward as possible, the deletion of the complete deployment and resources is semi-automated. To cleanup and remove everything you've deployed you need to do following:

1. Delete the Auto Scaling Group manually:
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for Auto Scaling Groups (EC2 featuer) in the search bar
- Select ComfyASG
- Press Actions and then delete
- Confirm deletion

2. After ASG deletion you just can run following command in your terminal. This command will delete all remaining resources, but EBS and the Cognito User pool.
```bash
cdk destroy
```

3. Delete EBS Volume
- Login to your AWS console
- Search Volumes (EC2 featuer) in the search bar
- Select ComfyUIVolume
- Press Actions and then delete
- Confirm deletion

4. Delete Cognito User Pool
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for Cognito in the serach bar
- Select ComfyUIuserPool..
- Press delete
- Confirm deletion

5. Delete ECR Repository
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for ECR (Elastic Container Regsitry) in the search bar
- Select comfyui
- Press delete
- Type delete to confirm deletion

## Notes and additional Information

### Cost considerations

‚ùó These cost indicators are only raw estimations. Feel free to refine them for your project / use case.  

Without any cost optimization the stack will incur approximately following costs per month.  
For the calcuation following conditions were used:

- Included nothing from the free tier
- Instance Type ```g4dn.2xlarge with 8 vCPU 32 GiB memory and 1 Nvidia T4 tensor core``` on-demand pricing
- 250 GB SSD storage with daily snapshots
- 1x Application Load Balancer
- VPC with 50 GB of data processed per Nat Gateway per month
- ECR with 10gb stored per month
- Logs with 5GB of logging data per month

| Service \ Runtime  | 2 hours a day | 8 hours a day | 12 hours a day | 24/7          |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Compute            | $45           | $183          | $275           | $550          |
| Storage            | -             | -             | -              | $35           |
| ALB                | -             | -             | -              | $20           |
| Networking         | -             | -             | -              | $70           |

| Logging            | -             | -             | -              | $3            |


With a little bit of optimization you achieve following costs:

‚ÑπÔ∏è For non-critical business workload (should apply to the majority of applications of this type) you can go with Spot Instances, which would lead to an average historical discount of 62% (Jul 2024) for g4dn.2xlarge. No Snapshot needed for storage for ephermal data. Replace NAT Gateway by NAT Instance.
